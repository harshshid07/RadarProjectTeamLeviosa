# RadarProjectTeamLeviosa
The Devices Monitoring System with Radar Visualization is a Python-based project designed to detect Network devices in real time, determine their location and display the position in a Tkinter-based graphical interface.
Our project focuses on developing a Python-based GUI application for real-time Wi-Fi network scanning and monitoring, integrating advanced features like:
ðŸ”¸ Real-time discovery of nearby Wi-Fi networks.
ðŸ”¸Visualization using a radar-style interface and dynamic graphs.
ðŸ”¸Environmental adjustments to signal strength measurements via WeatherAPI.
ðŸ”¸Seamless updates powered by multithreading.
